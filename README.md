# Sigma
Hello, Vaughn here, this is a Money Percentage Calculator that I use to divide up my finances in a particular way to avoid misusing my money.
I have the set percentages as follows,
40% = Invest
30% = The money I live off of
15% = Taxes
10% = Give away (This could be to a church for most people, or just to people who need it)
5% = Literally whatever I want

The main purpose of this is the invest first, spend after that, and If i need to have a certain amount be higher, 
I just need to make more money, rather than take it from the other accounts.

You can edit the percentages how you want depending on how you like to spend your money. However, Investments should never drop below 40%. 
This will ensure you have a good life in the future.

God Bless!
